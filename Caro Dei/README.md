During humanity's final moments, a mysterious object falls from the sky, containing within it the key to survival, or the final nail in the coffin.

Play as a reporter investigating the nature of this object, tell what remains of the world what they must do to survive.

Made from scratch in about 4 weeks for a class about horror games.

The code, art, story, and setting were created by Walker Jones. SFX were taken from a license-free SFX library. Some Godot tools were used as well.

All art was created in Aseprite.

# Tools used

## "Dialogic" by coppolaemilio; MIT; 2024-02-06

Used to handle dialog with other characters. I implemented a custom setup as all the default ones are more meant for full body portraits instead of headshots.
