# Walker Jones' Portfolio

A list of all video game projects I have worked on. 

All projects thus far have been made in Godot and were exclusively worked on by me, with the exception of some resources available publicly online. These resources are expanded upon in more detail in each project.

More detail about each project is within its directory.

## Caro Dei

A short horror visual novel made in about a month for a horror game history class.

## Untitled Puzzle Platformer

Inspired by Nintendo's [_Kuru Kuru Kururin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_Kuru_Kururin).

Still in development.
